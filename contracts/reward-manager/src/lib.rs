///
/// # Important: Limitations Under Panic=Abort
///
/// The Cargo.toml release profile sets `panic = "abort"`, which means no unwinding occurs
/// when a panic is triggered. In this configuration, Drop destructors do NOT run, and the
/// flag will remain set (true) indefinitely. This creates a permanent state:
/// - Any panic between ReentrancyGuard::acquire() and the end of distribute_rewards
///   (e.g., in token client, NFT handler, or arithmetic overflow) will cause the flag
///   to persist as true.
/// - All subsequent distribution calls will immediately fail with ReentrancyDetected.
/// - There is no admin path to clear this flag once set.
/// - The contract's core function is effectively disabled until the next ledger TTL expiration.
///
/// # Soroban Ledger TTL Behavior
///
/// However, Soroban's persistent storage uses a TTL (time-to-live) expiration model:
/// - Entries that are not accessed within the TTL window are automatically garbage collected.
/// - When the flag expires, the contract can resume normal operation.
/// - This provides eventual recovery without manual intervention.
///
/// To minimize risk of extended outage:
/// - Test thoroughly to prevent panics in the critical path.
/// - Keep calls to external contracts (token, NFT) as simple as possible.
/// - Monitor the ReentrancyDetected error rate in production metrics.
/// - Be prepared to document the TTL expiration timeline if this occurs.
